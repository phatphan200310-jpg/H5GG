# H5GG

**Discuss in [Discord](https://discord.gg/FAs4MH7HMc) or [iosgods.com](https://iosgods.com/forum/595-h5gg-igamegod/)**

an iOS Mod Engine with JavaScript APIs & Html5 UI.
## Currently BROKEN - Attempting multiple upgrades

## Universal Jailbreak Support (NEW!)

H5GG now includes [RootBridge](https://github.com/jjolano/RootBridge) for universal jailbreak compatibility:

✅ **Rootfull** - Traditional rooted jailbreaks (checkra1n, unc0ver)  
✅ **Rootless** - /var/jb based jailbreaks (palera1n, Dopamine 2.0)  
✅ **Roothide** - Roothide jailbreak support

**Build all modules for all three jailbreak types with one command:**
```bash
./build-all.sh
```

**Or build individual modules:**
```bash
./build-all-schemes.sh              # Main H5GG tweak
cd globalview && ./build-all-schemes.sh   # GlobalView module
cd appstand && ./build-all-schemes.sh     # AppStand module
```

See [RootBridge/README.md](/RootBridge/README.md) for detailed build instructions.

## This fork is a WIP

### To Do List

#### Core Improvements
- [ ] Migrate to WKWebView from the long deprecated UIWebView
- [ ] Find new hook method to reliably insert javascript to WKWebView

#### Feature Updates
- [ ] Add native Hex Viewer support
- [ ] Add search type for C-strings
- [ ] Add search address using IDA hex string signature supporting wildcards
- [ ] Add generation of hex signatures including wildcards from an address
- [ ] Create H5plugins providing support for reverse engineering common game frameworks (Unity, Unreal)
   
## Legacy Features:
provide memory [APIs](/examples-JavaScript/) likely Android-GG's Lua APIs.

support load scripts(*.js or *.html file) from loacl or network.

support load dylib plugin for javascript api ([demo](/pluginDemo/customAlert)).  

support [auto search static pointer and offsets of the value](/examples-JavaScript/AutoSearchPointerChains.js).

and you can customize UI by using [HTML+CSS](/examples-HTML5/) without computer.

and you can make your own tweak(dylib) by click one button, so easy!

**For fuzzy search it is recommended to use: https://igg-server.herokuapp.com/**

## H5GG supported 4 modes to run:

1. [inject H5GG.dylib to ipa for non-jailbreak devices](/packages/)

2. [tweak(deb) auto load into all app for jailbroken devices](/packages/)

3. [standalone APP for jailbroken devices(compatible with iPad's SlideOver+SplitView)](/appstand/packages/)

4. [Float On Screen for jailbroken devices(not compatible with iPad's SlideOver+SplitView), tested on ios11~ios14](/globalview/packages/)

  and there is [a special version for TrollStore](/appstand/packages/)

## [Debug the js/html of H5GG running on ios through macOS safari](https://www.lifewire.com/activate-the-debug-console-in-safari-445798):
the host app need get-task-allow entitlement (jailbroken or sign by Developer Certificate, not sign by Distribution Certificate)

## Dependences:

the GlobalView module of Floating APP requires these tweaks and may need to update for new ios version.
